# Multi-Core Processor Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the design, implementation, and testing of a multi-core processor. It involves various aspects such as cache coherence, interconnect design, and out-of-order execution.

## Project Status
**Currently in Progress**

## Features
- Multi-core architecture
- Cache coherence implementation
- Interconnect design
- Out-of-order execution support

## Work in Progress
- Implementing the last-level cache (LLC)
- Refining cache coherency protocols
- Testing and verification of the processor
- Performance optimization

## Technologies Used
- **Chisel** for hardware description
- **Bluespec System Verilog**
- **AXI Protocol** for interconnect
- **RISC-V Out-of-Order Processor Architecture**

## Getting Started
To work with this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Chisel toolchain
- Bluespec toolchain
- RISC-V toolchain
- Verilator for simulation
